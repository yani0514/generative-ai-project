"""Block 3. Does the model repeat itself, and does temperature decide?

    python 02_variance.py --full          # all eight cells, homework

Start with `--replay`. It reads a recording of ninety-six runs made on the
teaching machine and costs nothing, so the whole room is looking at the same
numbers while we discuss them. Then run your own two cells and see whether
your machine agrees.

The recording is real. `make_fixture.py` in the lab folder is what produced
it, and you can regenerate it yourself.

Three TODO markers.

    #        your machine agree with the recording?
    #     b. At temperature 1.0, one of the two cells still returns a single
    #        distinct answer. Which one, and why that one? The answer is not
    #        "the temperature did not work".
    #     c. A unit test asserting exact string equality would pass on some
    #        of these cells and fail on others. Name which, and say what
    #        that tells you about testing this system.

    # TODO 6. Then write down the one sentence that carries into week 10.

    #   does say about when you can and cannot rely on repeating an output.
